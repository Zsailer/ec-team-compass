# Executive Council Operational Details

## How decisions are made

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the
[Decision Making Guidelines](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making) described in the main Jupyter governance documents.

In short, we'll first seek an informal consensus. If a clear consensus cannot be reached, an active council member can call for a vote. The voting process then follows the guidelines laid out by the [Jupyter Governance model](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making).


## Code of Conduct

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the broader [Jupyter Community's Code of
Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)
