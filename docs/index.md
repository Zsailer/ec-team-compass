## About the Jupyter Executive Council

The [Jupyter Executive Council](https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html) (EC) is ultimately responsible for all dimensions of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (including, but not limited to, software, legal, financial, community, operations, inclusion and diversity, etc.). The members of the EC actively work to carry out the Projectâ€™s mission in accordance with its values and to support operations through delegation to the Software Steering Council (SSC), Software Subprojects, Standing Committees, and Working Groups. These other bodies will report to the EC, and the EC is expected to support, oversee, manage, and ensure the success of operations across Jupyter. For more details, see the [Jupyter Executive Council](https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html) page of the [Jupyter governance](https://jupyter.org/governance) structure.

For more details about how the Executive Council operates, see the [operational details](operations).
