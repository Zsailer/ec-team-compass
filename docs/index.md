# Jupyter Executive Council Team Compass

The [Jupyter Executive Council](https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html) (EC) is ultimately responsible for all dimensions of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (including, but not limited to, software, legal, financial, community, operations, inclusion and diversity, etc.). The members of the EC actively work to carry out the Projectâ€™s mission in accordance with its values and to support operations through delegation to the Software Steering Council (SSC), Software Subprojects, Standing Committees, and Working Groups. These other bodies will report to the EC, and the EC is expected to support, oversee, manage, and ensure the success of operations across Jupyter. For more details, see the [Jupyter Executive Council](https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html) page of the [Jupyter governance](https://jupyter.org/governance) structure.

This team compass contains information about the regular activities of the EC.

## How decisions are made

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the
[Decision Making Guidelines](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making) described in the main Jupyter governance documents.

In short, we'll first seek an informal consensus. If a clear consensus cannot be reached, an active council member can call for a vote. The voting process then follows the guidelines laid out by the [Jupyter Governance model](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making).


## Code of Conduct

The Jupyter Executive Council follows the broader [Jupyter Community's Code of
Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)
