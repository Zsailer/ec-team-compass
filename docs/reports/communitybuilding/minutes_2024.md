# Jupyter Community Building Working Group 2024 Meeting Minutes


## 23 May 2024

* EC Reports: We reviewed and discussed 2023 H2 (second half of 2023) and discussed 2024 H1. This led to discussion surrounding cadence of reports and led to a bigger conversation about transparency and weekly minutes. 
* Transparency: Improving transparency for this working group
* Public minutes need to be established. Jason will create a place in the EC team compass for our weekly public minutes
* Reviewed options for publishing minutes on GH
  * POV of non engineer - GH is not user friendly, can be confusing
  * Maintainer Summit - Jason attended
    * Jason feels like we have GHâ€™s ear about feedback we want to give about functionality and features. If we encounter issues we should keep that in mind. Figure out what our top ask is if we want to submit. 
* Community Interviews: Tabled the discussion of recommendations in the community survey report in favor of discussion above
