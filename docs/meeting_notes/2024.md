- Brian Granger

### Notes

- Met with Linux Foundation to continue drafting the Jupyter Foundation charter.
- Updated the [LF proposal governance PR](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/226) to streamline it down to just changes related to the move to Linux Foundation. Moved administrative changes to [another PR](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/228).
- Added a follow-up in the code of conduct incident log – which arose from Zach asking about a public issue that we discussed in the EC but did not have any note of what happened in the follow-up.
- Discussed next steps for the [Jupyter Book subproject proposal](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/123). Jason posted [a comment on behalf of the EC](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/123#issuecomment-2176567556) asking that a governance PR be opened as a next step for the EC to vote on the proposal.
- Request for feedback from Jupyter Media Strategy (JMS) Documentation Working Group write up of “What is Jupyter”. Ana will share feedback with JMS.
